Project name: Coping with the Storm: Extreme Rainfall and  Rural Land Abandonment in Colombia.

Abstract:

This paper examines how extreme rainfall shocks influence land-use decisions in rural Colombia. I combine satellite-based yearly land-use classification data with historical precipitation records and employ a difference-in-differences framework with multiple time periods to estimate the causal impact of extreme weather events. The results show that municipalities exposed to extreme rainfall experience a significant reduction in cropland share and a concurrent increase in bare ground area, consistent with land abandonment. These effects are more pronounced in municipalities with higher credit application rates, suggesting a coping strategy of migration and land abandonement. Furthermore, municipalities with a higher proportion of unproductive land experience larger losses in cropland, while those with more productive land tend to receive some migration by increase in built-up areas. These findings high light the heterogeneous adaptive responses to weather shocks and their implications for rural land-use dynamics under extreme rainfalls
